            <h3>What is IPFS?</h3>
                The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed file system that aims to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. 
                It is designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. Here are the key concepts and features of IPFS:
                <ul style="list-style-type:number">
                    <li>
                        <h4>Content Addressing:</h4>
                        <p>
                            IPFS identifies files by their content rather than their location (URL). Each file is given a unique cryptographic hash, called a Content Identifier (CID). 
                            This ensures that the content is tamper-proof and verifiable.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Decentralization:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Unlike traditional centralized servers, IPFS is a decentralized system where files are stored across multiple nodes in a network. 
                            This eliminates single points of failure and reduces dependency on any one server.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>P2P File Sharing:</h4>
                        <p>
                            IPFS uses a peer-to-peer network to distribute files. 
                            When a user requests a file, the system retrieves it from the nearest nodes that have the file, improving efficiency and speed.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Versioning and Immutability:</h4>
                        <p>
                            IPFS supports file versioning. When a file is updated, a new CID is generated for the new version, while the old version remains accessible. 
                            This immutability ensures that historical data can be reliably retrieved.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Efficiency:</h4>
                        <p>
                            By caching and sharing files across multiple nodes, IPFS can reduce bandwidth usage and improve load times. 
                            Popular files can be served from many nodes, reducing the load on individual nodes.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Integration with Blockchain:</h4>
                        <p>
                            IPFS can be used in conjunction with blockchain technology to create decentralized applications (DApps). 
                            For example, IPFS can store the data, while the blockchain manages the access control and transactions.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Interoperability:</h4>
                        <p>
                            IPFS can work with existing web protocols and systems. 
                            It can serve traditional web content and integrate with the HTTP protocol, making it easier to adopt.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Security and Privacy:</h4>
                        <p>
                            The cryptographic hashing ensures data integrity, and files are encrypted and can be shared privately between users.
                        </p>
                    </li>
